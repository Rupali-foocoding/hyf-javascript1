/* 1. Strings!
Consider the following string:*/

let myString = "hello,this,is,a,difficult,to,read,sentence";
console.log(myString) //1.1 Add the string to your file and log it.
myString.length //1.2 Log the length of myString.
let myStringWithoutCommas = myString.replaceAll(',', ' ')//1.3 The commas make that the sentence is quite hard to read. Find a way to remove the commas from the string and replace them with spaces.
console.log(myStringWithoutCommas) //1.4 Log myString to see if you succeeded.
